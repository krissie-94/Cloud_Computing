# Collaborative Filtering using MLlib
## 1. What is Collanorative Filtering :
### ***Collaborative filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item association matrix. spark.mllib currently supports model-based collaborative filtering, in which users and products are described by a small set of latent factors that can be used to predict missing entries.***
